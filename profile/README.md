## About Pixelmator Pro
Pixelmator Pro represents a modern approach to image editing, combining professional-grade capabilities with accessibility through intelligent automation and thoughtful interface design. It leverages Apple's Core ML framework to provide machine learning features that simplify complex editing tasks while maintaining the depth and control required by professionals. The application addresses the evolving needs of image creators by integrating traditional pixel-based editing with vector design tools and non-destructive workflows, creating a versatile environment suitable for photography enhancement, graphic design, digital painting, and compositing.
